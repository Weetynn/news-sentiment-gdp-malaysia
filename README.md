# Leveraging News Sentiment to Forecast GDP's Demand Components: A Malaysian Case Study

## 📚 Introduction
This study examines the role of Mandarin news sentiment in forecasting Malaysia's GDP and its demand-side components - private investment, private consumption, imports, and exports. Given the delays in publishing key economic indicators, the research explores alternative methods for capturing economic sentiment through the analysis of Mandarin news articles. By analyzing Mandarin news articles and applying machine learning models, this study aims to provide more timely and accurate forecasts of Malaysia’s GDP and its key economic components.

## 📋 Critical Discussion Points

### CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

#### 📌 Problem Statements

    ▪️ Macroeconomic indicators like GDP are reported with a 90-day delay in Malaysia, limiting timely decision-making.
    
    ▪️ The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for real-time economic insights, as traditional indicators like GDP were too slow to capture rapid economic changes.
    
    ▪️ Survey-based indices like Business Condition Index (BCI) and CSI (Consumer Sentiment Index) often provide incomplete or biased data during economic downturns due to low response rates.

    ▪️ Most research focuses on English-language news sentiment, overlooking non-English sources like Mandarin, which is significant in Malaysia's multilingual context.
    
    ▪️ The study focuses on the predictive power of Mandarin news sentiment for forecasting Malaysia’s GDP, due to time and resource constraints.
    
    ▪️ Although high-frequency indicators are used in nowcasting, the study applies them to a quarterly forecasting task due to the available data.


#### 📌 Project Questions

The questions that this study aims to address are outlined as follows: 

    ▪️ Does the news sentiment index which is computed in the study accurately reflect the BCI and CSI published by the MIER?
    
    ▪️ How was the performance of the Mandarin text-derived news sentiment when compared to the English text-derived news sentiment in the work of Chong et al. (2021)?
    
    ▪️ Which of the four demand-side components (private investment, private consumption, imports, and exports) of GDP exhibited a strong correlation with the newly constructed news sentiment index, and which of the components showed a weak correlation to the index?
